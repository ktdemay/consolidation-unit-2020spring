# Legends Never Die
My goal for this project was to make a visual image to celebrate the careers of 6 of my favorite artsits who have unfortunately passed away. I wanted this piece to serve homage to these talented artists who have all impacted me in different ways. I made the image in the style of an album cover to celebrate their collective impacts on the music industry.
